1. Upload the 'custom-stock-widget' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

1. Activate the Custom Stock Widget plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

1. Set Look and Stocks in Settings->StockWidget

1. Place Shortcodes
 * Pages / Posts: 
  Add the shortcode `[stock-widget]` to where you want the widget shown in your post/page.
 * Themes: 
  Add the PHP code `<?php echo do_shortcode('[stock-widget]'); ?>` where you want the widget to show up.

  There are many plugins that enable shortcode or PHP in widgets. 
  Here are two great ones: [Shortcode Widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-widget/) and [PHP Code Widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/php-code-widget/)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I get data for any company? =
The current version of the plugin supports most stocks on NASDAQ and NYSE.

= How do I add stocks to the ticker? =

All stocks can be added in the Stock Widget settings page (Settings -> StockWidget). 

Go to Settings -> StockWidget
Type in your stock list separated by commas in the Stocks input box.

= How do I place the shortcode into a widget? =
You need a plugin that enables shortcode or PHP widgets.

There are plenty of such plugins on the WordPress.org. 
These worked well for us: [Shortcode Widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-widget/), [PHP Code Widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/php-code-widget/)

Install and activate the such your desired shortcode or PHP widget plugin and add it to the desired sidebar/section (Appearance->Widgets)

If you added a shortcode widget, type in `[stock-widget]` inside it.

If you added a PHP widget, type in `<?php echo do_shortcode('[stock-widget]'); ?>` inside it.

That will display the widget in the appropriate space.

= What is the Customize Categories section all about? =

If you want to display a different set of stocks for specific categories on your page, you can specify them for each category. If you leave a field next to a category blank, the default list will be loaded.

= Can I place two widgets with different formatting on one page? =

Yes. Specify any variations in the shortcode.

For example: `[stock-widget display="4" width="300" height="200" background_color1="#133735" background_color2="grey" text_color="yellow"]`


= The widget is too big! Is there some way to shrink it? =
Yes. Put in a smaller number in the width/height in Stock Widget Settings (Settings->StockWidget). Both are in pixels. Alternatively, you can enter a smaller width in the shortcode. 

For example: `[stock-widget width="280"]`


= Where can I find all the options for customizing a shortcode outside of the input box UI?

All shortcode options are in the Advanced example:
`[stock-widget display="4" width="300" height="200" background_color1="#133735" background_color2="grey" text_color="yellow"]`

The options are:

* display (number of stocks per screen)
* width (pixels)
* height (pixels)
* background_color1 (hex)
* background_color2 (hex)
* text_color (hex)
